   * A utility method that can be used to prepare a PDF document that is to be signed with a PDF signature image with a
   * PDF signature page holding the signature image(s).
   * <p>
   * A PDF signature image can be inserted into a signed PDF document to make the signature information "visible". The
   * image along with the coordinates that tell where in the PDF document the images should be inserted is represented
   * using a {@link VisiblePdfSignatureRequirement} object. See {@link TbsDocument#getVisiblePdfSignatureRequirement()}.
   * </p>
   * <p>
   * However, for the generic case, where we may not always know how the PDF document we are signing looks like it may
   * be tricky to determine where in the document the PDF signature image should be inserted. For those cases, a
   * dedicated "PDF signature page"may be added to the PDF document before it is added to a {@link TbsDocument} object
   * and sent as input in a signature operation. By using a PDF signature page whose structure and constitution is well
   * known it is easy to include a PDF signature image into any PDF document being signed.
   * </p>
   * <p>
   * Also, since a PDF document can be signed several times, using a PDF signature page it is easy to include signature
   * images for all signatures of the document.
   * </p>
   * <p>
   * The {@code preparePdfSignaturePage} method should invoked before each call to
   * {@link SignServiceIntegrationService#createSignRequest(SignRequestInput)} where PDF documents with PDF signature
   * pages is to be used. If a PDF document is to be signed more than once and the PDF signature page supports several
   * signature images, by default no new PDF signature page is added (see
   * {@link PdfSignaturePagePreferences#isAddToAlreadySigned()}. Instead, the {@code preparePdfSignaturePage} method
   * calculates where in the already existing PDF signature page the next signature image will be inserted.
   * </p>
   * 
   * @param policy
   *          the policy under which the operation is performed (see {@link SignRequestInput#getPolicy()})
   * @param pdfDocument
   *          the contents of the PDF document that is to be prepared
   * @param signaturePagePreferences
   *          the PDF signature page preferences
   * @return a PreparedPdfDocument object containing the modified PDF document (if a sign page was added) and the
   *         VisiblePdfSignatureRequirement telling how a signature image should be added
   * @throws InputValidationException
   *           for input validation errors
   * @throws SignServiceIntegrationException
   *           for processing errors
